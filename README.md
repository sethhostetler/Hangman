# Hangman
A basic version of the game Hangman
I developed this program during the course of an edX course through MIT - 6.00.1x.

In this program, the user has a set number of tries to guess a word selected from a list at random.  THe program displays what letters of the alphabet haven't been guessed, and updates the list whenever the user picks a new letter.
