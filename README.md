# Hangman
A basic version of the game Hangman.
I developed this program during an edX course through MIT, and made some changes afterwards.

In this program, the user has a set number of tries to guess a word selected from a list at random.  The program displays what letters of the alphabet haven't been guessed, and updates the list whenever the user picks a new letter.
